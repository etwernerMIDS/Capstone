# NFT Price Prediction

Sales of non-fungible tokens ('NFT") reached nearly $25 billion in 2021, a 1,000% increase over a two-year period.  Thousands of NFTs are bought and sold each week.  Facebook has bet heavily on the future of the "metaverse", and companies such as Nike have filed patents to issue NFTs that are linked to its physical products. Growth in interest and value of NFTs appears likely to increase.
 
Non-fungible tokens are currently focused primarily on collectibles, and one of the challenges with all forms of collectibles is valuation.  This project aims to build upon previous work from Matthieu Nadini et al. to predict prices of NFTs in the secondary market. In that paper, Nadini et al. used regression models to predict secondary prices based on information related to i) trader networks, ii) sales history and iii) visual features of the underlying digital asset. The authors did not pursue more sophisticated machine learning models to predict pricing, for example Long Short-Term Memory networks, and that will be the focus of this project.
 
Current applications such as www.nonfungible.com and www.dappradar.com provide a vast amount of data on NFT market activity.  However, there does not appear to be a solution to help potential NFT investors and sellers predict the future prices of NFT assets.

The overall purpose of our Capstone project is to build product to predict the price changes of NFTs. From various research and user interaction we determined that a tool to predict price changes could be useful for both NFT creators and investors. We found the space interesting because NFTs are a fast growing asset market, and there is a diverse set of use cases and interested parties
