# NFT Prediction Capstone Project

This is the repository for all jupyter notebooks and production code for the NFT prediction capstone project.

## Repository Content and Structure

- [EDA](https://github.com/jrday93/nft_capstone/tree/main/EDA) contains all notebooks related to initial exploration and analysis of the primary data set.
- [Final Project/flask_api](https://github.com/jrday93/nft_capstone/tree/readme_edit/Final%20Project/flask_api) contains all of the code used in the final production flask API.
- [Models](https://github.com/jrday93/nft_capstone/tree/readme_edit/Models) contains all of the notebooks related to model experimentation and development. The three models we explored are [ARIMA](https://github.com/jrday93/nft_capstone/tree/readme_edit/Models/ARIMA), [LSTM](https://github.com/jrday93/nft_capstone/tree/readme_edit/Models/LSTM), and multiple implementations of [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/jrday93/nft_capstone/tree/readme_edit/Models/Logistic%20Regression).
- [other_data](https://github.com/jrday93/nft_capstone/tree/readme_edit/other_data) contains various data files generated by EDA and models notebooks crucial for model generation.

There are also a number of data files referenced in the notebook and API code stored in AWS S3 and GCP storage.

## API Usage

In `flask_api` folder on a machine with Docker installed, run the following to start a container with the API:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 --name flask_api jeffday1113/mids-repo:multi-platform
```

To query the API, make a GET call to the machine running the API container at port 8000 with the following query params:

```
-collection_name: <Cleaned collection name as in reference dataset>
-nft_name: <Cleaned collection name as in reference dataset>
-category: <NFT category as in reference dataset>
-nft_id: <NFT id as in reference dataset>
```
